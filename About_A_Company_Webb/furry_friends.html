    <img src="animal_photos/calico_10.jpg" alt="Calico Cat">
    <div class="text">Finicky is a beautiful Calico. She is leary of dogs

    <div class="numbertext">7 / 16</div>
    <img src="animal_photos/maine_coon_2.jpg" alt="Maine Coon">
    <div class="text">This is Sleepy; he yawns a lot and likes to lounge

  </div>

  <div class="furry_friends">
    <div class="numbertext">9 / 16</div>
    <img src="animal_photos/pit_bull_4.jpg" alt="Pit Bull">
    <div class="text">Meet Tiny; the pit bull! He is a bundle of love and thinks he
      is a lap dog! If you need a loyal companion who will stick by your side through
      thick and thin, then Tiny is your man!!</div>

  <div class="furry_friends">
    <div class="numbertext">12 / 16</div>
    <img src="animal_photos/siamese_5.jpg" alt="Siamese">
    <div class="text">These two siamese come from the same litter.
      Yukio and Zara are both females. Siamese like to have full run of the home
      so if you are thinking of adopting a second cat, I would suggest
      getting a different breed; although alone the siamese make great pets! </div>
  </div>

  <div class="furry_friends">
    <div class="numbertext">13 / 16</div>
    <img src="animal_photos/siamese_6.jpg" alt="Siamese">
    <div class="text">Jasmine loves to roam outdoors. She would be happier as a
      mouse hunter than a fully indoor house cat. She might roam for a day or two
      but she will always come back.</div>

    <div class="text">Meet Spanky! Spanky has the power to bark storms away. He is
      one of the friendliest dogs in our shelter and would be fabulous if placed in a
      home with lots of children!.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="furry_friends">
    <div class="numbertext">16 / 16</div>
    <img src="animal_photos/sphinx_4.jpg" alt="Sphinx">
    <div class="text">Renoir and Brissa are both female Sphinx kittens. They are
      perfect for houeholds in which a family member is allergic to dander. Since
      these cats are hairless, they have little to no dander and are able to be able to
      be bathed quite easily which also reduces the risk of allergins. Renoir and Brissa
      would make regal additions to your beautiful family! </div>
