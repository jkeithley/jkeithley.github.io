    <p>At <strong>Webb's Wags & Wiggles Pet Shop </strong> we rescue animals in
      distress. We have contact information on our website in order for those
      who see an animal in need to contact us. Once we have been contacted we
      will go out and retrieve the animal and nurse it back to health. Once we
      have confirmed it is healthy enough to go to a new home, the animals are
      put up for adoption. All adoptable animals have had all necessary shots
      and have been microchipped. All cats and dogs must be fixed prior to
      adoption. If you are in need of a place to bring a pet that you simply
      cannot take care of, or have found a stray animal, please do not hesitate
      to call or drop in. We appreciate our customers and all donations we
      receive go towards our animals care and adoption process. <strong>WE ARE
        A NO KILL ANIMAL SHELTER</strong></p>
