  <h1>What I Do For Fun</h1>
  <p>I don't have a lot of hobbies. I watch a lot of Netflix and Amazon.
    My main hobby is painting. I have painted a desk my father made for my
    daughter, painted an Evee evolutions drawing I created, and started a
    level 3 adult paint by numbers. I love to create works of art for my
    daughter, friends, and family.</p>
  <p>I also play a lot of Minecraft with my daughter. We have recently
    learned how to add modifications to the Java edition on her
    desktop. I absolutely love watching my daughter learn; so I suppose
    teaching her new things; especially computer related, is also a hobby
    of mine.</p>
  <p>If you would like to try out modifications in Minecraft Java Edition; I
    highly suggest using the
    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods" target="_blank">Curseforge</a>
    website.
